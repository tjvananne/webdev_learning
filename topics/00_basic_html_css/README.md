# 00 Basic HTML / CSS

The goal here is to just spend some time (re)learning html tag structuring and basic CSS design. I'd like to build
good design habits from the very beginning, so I'm going to use BEM (block, element, modifier) CSS naming convention.


## subtopics:

* HTML / CSS basics
* Implement CSS with BEM naming conventions
* Implement (super simple) media queries for responsiveness
* Look into css grid
